I like James Shore definition " 'Dependency Injection' is a 25-dollar term for a 5-cent concept..."
https://www.jamesshore.com/Blog/Dependency-Injection-Demystified.html
"Dependency injection means giving an object its instance variables. Really. That's it."

In more details:
When writing a class, it makes use of other objects. 
You may have a database connection, logger, some other service that you use. 
These other objects (or services) are dependencies.
The simplest way to write the code is simply to create and use those other objects.
But this means your object has an inflexible relationship to those dependencies:
 no matter why you are invoking your object, it uses the same dependencies.

A more powerful technique is to be able to create your object and provide it with dependencies to use. 
So you might create a database connection to use, then hand it to your object. 
This way, you can create your object with different dependencies at different times,
 making your object more flexible. This is dependency injection, where you "inject" the dependencies into the object.
