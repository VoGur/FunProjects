The requirement was to implement working code in C++ for    
Omaha Poker (dealt 4 cards instead of 2 and yu must use any of 2 dealt with 3 community cards) version.
2 players and community card given as parameters in input file. 
C++ code compiled and tested in VS2017, working well since I got interview after the test, didnt like the interview but it another story.
